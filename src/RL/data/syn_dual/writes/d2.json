Meanwhile, on Earth, the United Nations is debating the 'Terraforming Accord' for Mars, which proposes a 100-year plan to make Mars habitable. Key proponents include the Martian Colonization Authority. Opponents cite the immense cost and potential ecological risks to Martian proto-life, if it exists. The current Martian atmospheric pressure is less than 1% of Earth's. Water ice has been confirmed at Mars' poles. The 'Phoenix Lander' discovered perchlorates in Martian soil. A separate research team at MIT just announced a breakthrough in room-temperature superconductivity using a graphene-based composite. This could revolutionize energy transmission and computing.
