Is it only about video games?\nMemory:\nMemory 1: Game theory,is,branch of mathematics and economics\nMemory 2: Game theory,studies,strategic interaction between rational decision-makers\nMemory 3: Prisoner's Dilemma,is,classic example in game theory\nGenerated Thinking and Response: Game theory is not just about video games, though it can be applied to them. It's a theoretical framework for conceiving social situations among competing players. In more formal terms, it's the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. It has applications in economics, political science, psychology, biology, and computer science. It analyzes situations where players' choices are interdependent. A 'game' in this context can be any situation where the outcome depends on the choices of multiple participants.",

It does not mean everything is random. Chaotic systems are deterministic, meaning their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved.
