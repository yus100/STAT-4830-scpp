Is it only about video games?\nMemory:\nMemory 1: Game theory,is,branch of mathematics and economics\nMemory 2: Game theory,studies,strategic interaction between rational decision-makers\nMemory 3: Prisoner's Dilemma,is,classic example in game theory\nGenerated Thinking and Response: Game theory is not just about video games, though it can be applied to them. It's a theoretical framework for conceiving social situations among competing players. In more formal terms, it's the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. It has applications in economics, political science, psychology, biology, and computer science. It analyzes situations where players' choices are interdependent. A 'game' in this context can be any situation where the outcome depends on the choices of multiple participants.",
