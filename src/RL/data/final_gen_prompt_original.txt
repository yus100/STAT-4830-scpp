Conversation with Gemini

I'm writing a dataset to fine-tune an RL local-LLM for my needs. The local LLM is optimized for using and writing to a graph RAG-like system for improved learning and memory. It has 2 functions: recall (<memory_ask>) and write (<memory_write>).



Based on the user input, it should call the right function. It should NEVER answer the question, or write anything else. If there is more than one function needed, it can stack them. All stacked functions should be homogenous (i.e. do not mix asks and writes.)



Make sure that if the model cannot write/ask anything from the prompt, it DOES NOT. If there is no information to write, it does not have to write anything, same thing with asks. For example, a prompt with Hi, does not read or write anything most likely, so just return an empty string.



Below is the order it should evaluate (the first one with the highest priority and decreasing)

If the input has "Output Generated. Write Memory." it should ALWAYS do <memory_write>. The input will be of the format



"

Output Generated. Write Memory.



Input Question: ....



Memory:

Memory 1:

Memory 2:

Memory 3:

...

Memory N:

in this case. Additionally, in this case, if some information contradicts old information, it should write that to memory. It does not need to write information already in memory. If it fixing contradicting memory, it should repeat the entire memory, with the changed information.



In other cases (below), it gets just the input question.

If the input is a question: it should ALWAYS do <memory_ask>

If the input is a statement: it should ALWAYS do <memory_write>

If the input has both a statement and a question: it should ALWAYS do <memory_ask>



If there is something that can't really be posed as a question, just write <memory_ask>Information about [thing]</memory_ask>. It's just basically a multiquery to be used to query a RAG database anyways.



Please generate synthetic data to train this model. I need at least 50 of EACH type (all 4), of varying sizes, varying domains/questions, varying amount of memory retrieved, varying iunput questions, varying complexity, varying output questions, varying amount of stacked functions, etc... VARY EVERYTHING. BE UNIQUE. I will give you examples, but you can stray and generate with creativity, these are meant to guide you, NOT constrain you. However, follow the spirit of this prompt.

input: what color is John's car

input: The blue toilet is in the bathroom. The bathroom is next to the living room.

response: <memory_write>There is a blue toilet is in the bathroom</memory_write><memory_write>The bathroom is next to the living room</memory_write>



input: There is a hospital with 100 patients as 12 Harrison Ln in New Jersey. New Jersey is a great state isnt it? The hospital has a lot of doctors. Doctor's are great aren't they? There is one doctor named Dr. Gray. What role does Dr. Gray play? Also Dr.Gray's car is blue.

response: <memory_ask>What is the hospital</memory_ask><memory_ask>What is at 12 Harrison Ln in New Jersey</memory_ask><memory_ask>Information about New Jersey?</memory_ask><memory_ask>Information about Doctors?</memory_ask><memory_ask>Information about Doctors</memory_ask><memory_ask>Who is Dr. Gray</memory_ask><memory_ask>What role does Dr. Gray play?</memory_ask><memory_ask>What is Dr. Gray's car</memory_ask>



input:

Output Generated. Write Memory.



Input Question: How old is Jimmy. Jimmy lives next to Kate. Jimmy goes to school at UT Austin. Jimmy is a female.



Memory:

Memory 1: Jimmy is a male living in Texas.

Memory 2: Jimmy's parent own a nice house and a Honda Civic

Memory 3: Jimmy's goes to school at the University of Texas at Austin.

Memory 4: There is an apple on the teacher's desk



Generated Thinking and Response: I do not have information about Jimmy's age.

response: <memory_write>Jimmy lives next to Kate</memory_write><memory_write>Jimmy is a female living in Texas.</memory_write>
