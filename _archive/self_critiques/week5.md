# Self-Critique: MAGS - Dynamic Memory Modules for Large Language Models via Liquid Knowledge Graphs

## OBSERVE

### Initial Reactions
- The report presents a clear and detailed technical approach but is dense and difficult to parse for new readers.
- The mathematical formulation is useful but could be better connected to the implementation specifics.
- Code implementation is functional but faces issues with JSON formatting and instruction-following in model responses.
- Inference stability was observed, but resource utilization could be optimized further.
- RL training is incomplete, limiting full evaluation.

## ORIENT

### Strengths
- **Innovative Problem Framing:** The proposal clearly defines limitations in existing LLMs and offers a structured, neuroscience-inspired approach.
- **Technical Depth:** Covers essential aspects such as reinforcement learning, graph structures, and long-term memory consolidation.
- **Implementation Progress:** Initial implementation shows promising memory retrieval and knowledge persistence capabilities.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Clarity and Readability:** The document is highly technical but lacks a structured flow that makes it accessible to a broader audience.
- **Mathematical Rigor and Explanation:** While an optimization function is presented, the explanation of its impact on model behavior could be expanded.
- **Implementation Robustness:** JSON formatting issues and instruction-following inconsistencies need debugging, possibly requiring a stronger instruct model.

### Critical Risks/Assumptions
- The RL modelâ€™s ability to correctly reinforce memory retrieval and updates is unproven due to incomplete implementation.
- Memory consolidation might introduce excessive complexity, requiring additional fine-tuning to avoid instability or unnecessary resource usage.
- Current compute resources (half CPU cores, limited GPU availability) may not be sufficient for full-scale training.

## DECIDE

### Concrete Next Actions
- **Refactor Report Structure:** Introduce clearer sectioning, summaries, and figures to improve readability and comprehension.
- **Refine Mathematical Explanation:** Add derivations or simple examples demonstrating how loss components influence model behavior.
- **Fix JSON and Instruction Adherence Issues:** Test alternative models (e.g., larger/instruction-tuned) and improve prompt design for better response formatting.

## ACT

### Resource Needs
- **Larger Model Access:** To test instruction-following and memory retrieval effectiveness, an instruct model or a model with more parameters may be needed.
- **Graph Processing Tools:** Efficient graph algorithms (e.g., PyTorch Geometric) should be further explored to handle dynamic updates effectively.
- **More Compute Resources:** Full RL training requires stable GPU access to assess training convergence and effectiveness.
