# Self-Critique: MAGS - Dynamic Memory Modules for Large Language Models via Liquid Knowledge Graphs

## OBSERVE
- Core problem and vision remain consistent. A new informal success metric (compariosn to Auren) was introduced
- Planned pivot to dual-model architecture was delayed; still evaluating single-model approach with larger models and expanded data first.
- Switched from custom PPO to GRPO via the unsloth library, which drastically improved training speed and memory efficiency.
- Synthetic dataset has been significantly expanded and reportedly has more variety
- Integration was achieved. Trained model has now been integrated with the basic graph system. 
- First formal results using integrated system have been preseented.
- "Adherence" has improved significantly (~60% vs earlier ~30%), especially with larger models.
- Game performance shows a ~30% improvement over the base model and shows that the implementation provides measurable benefits.
- Still relying on custom game and evaluation against base/static RAG models for the game performance results.
- Persistent and significant problems with Google Colab Free Tier. Unsloth's lack of Mac support forces Colab.
- Significant learning about unsloth vs. custom RL implementation and its benefits in speed and efficiency.


## ORIENT

### Strengths
- Major integration milestone when integrated RL model with graph system.
- Demonstrated ~30% performance gain, showing concrete evidence yields tangible results.
- Solves PPO inefficiency with unsloth
- Increase to ~60% adherence suggests recall/engram steps are getting better
- Larger models improve performance 
- Switching RL implementations 

### Areas for Improvement
- Still missing core MAGS features such as Hebbian plasticity, decay, pruning, k-core
- Lack of automated test  cases for RL agent's behavior and graph manipulation reduces ability to systematically test and track performance.
- Reliance on Colab is a drag on productivity
- There still isn't a clear link between the mathematical formulation and the implementation for the second term. 

### Critical Risks/Assumptions
- The hypothesis of adding the core graph dynamics proposed is still untested, and the complex dynamics may pose different issues or not yield success.
- Without scalable workflow and compute environment, testing remains difficult.
- The planned two-model approach may introduce new integration and training complexities not anticipated.
- Synthetic data may not generalize well to real-world LLM use cases, limiting applicability.

## DECIDE
- First priority, implement core graph dynamics (Hebbian edge plasticity, pruning, contradiction handling, traversals, k-core)
- Explore options beyond Colab or developt robust scripting/checkpointing to mitigate risks of lost work.
- Integrate automated tests for key components, and verify that RL agent's output is correctly parsed.
- Evaluate the two-model system and define how its performance will be compared to the single-model approach.
- Refine mathematical formulation explanation still

## ACT
### Resource Needs
- Development time
- Scalable resource environment
- Testing framework development

### Approaches
- Develop the graph dynamic features as distinct modules within existing graph system
- Iterative graph feature development -- implement and test features one by one to manaage complexity
- Dedicate time to find alternative compute resources and writing robust scripts for training, checkpointing, and model downloading
- Test-driven development adoption
- Refine prompting for structure
