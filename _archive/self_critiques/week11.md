# Self-Critique: MAGS - Dynamic Memory Modules for Large Language Models via Liquid Knowledge Graphs

## OBSERVE
- Core objective is consistent.
- Fundamental change in the mmeory representation schema, pivoting from unstructrud text nodes to triplate-based schema.
- Switched to Gemma models, led to improved performance
- Previously planned switch to separate recall and engram models has been successfully implemented and integrated, showing improvements.
- Several core graph dynamic algorithms have been implemneted and integrated with the triplet schema. Pruning and edge permanence are being observed.
- New triplet schema, updated datasets, trained Gemma models, and some initial graph algorithms are integrated into working system prototype.
- New, larger datasets aligned with triplet schema are created and used for training.
- Performance metrics: Nothing currently for graphs, ~5% improvement in RAG performance, Adherence showed improvement but not quantified, game performance was not explicitly re-measured, validation methodology still lacks automated test cases 
- Resource usage takes relatively low ongoing resource use. Training speed using Unsloth remains efficient 
- Difficulty reconciling/consolidating information structured as triplets, especially with same subject/verb.
- Slow manual evaluation process hinders hyperparameter tuning and validation workflow
- LLM context window limitation impacting amount of triplet data that can be effectively processed simulataneously during retrieval.


## ORIENT

### Strengths
- Significant Architectural Progress: The successful implementation of the triplet schema and the integration of the separated recall/engram models are major technical achievements, realizing key components of the updated vision.
- Working Integrated Prototype: Having a system where models interact with a dynamic graph (even with basic dynamics) is a critical step towards testing the core hypothesis.
- Intelligent Design Decisions: The pivot to triplets and model separation were based on observations and likely improve the foundation for future MAGS features compared to the initial text-node/single-model approach.
- Efficient Training Pipeline: Unsloth continues to be a success in making the model training feasible and relatively fast.
- Visible Graph Dynamics: Observing pruning and permanency provides early validation that the decay/strengthening algorithms are functional.
- Improved Model Adherence: The separated models seem to have solved the mixing/garbage output problem encountered previously, making the system outputs more reliable.

### Areas for Improvement
- Core MAGS Features Still Missing: Reconciliation, consolidation, semantic/episodic memory utilization, and k-core decomposition are critical, complex parts of the original MAGS vision that are yet to be implemented.
- Lack of Rigorous Validation for Graph Dynamics: Without automated metrics and an efficient evaluation pipeline, it's impossible to quantitatively measure the impact of implemented graph algorithms (decay, strengthening, pruning) or systematically tune hyperparameters.
- Reconciliation/Consolidation Unsolved: This is identified as a major technical challenge and requires significant design/research effort, potentially involving complex logic or re-introducing LLM capabilities in a structured way despite the schema rigidity.
- Context Window Limitation: While noted, this limitation impacts how much relevant triplet data can be fed back into the LLM, potentially capping the performance benefit even with intelligent retrieval.
- Compute Workflow Issues Persist: Although training is faster, Colab instability and manual downloading remain a significant workflow bottleneck and risk.
- Unquantified Performance: Aside from the 5% RAG proxy, the overall system performance (in the game, against key metrics) hasn't been clearly measured or compared since the last iteration with the fully integrated system.

### Critical Risks/Assumptions
- Reconciliation/Consolidation Complexity: These are hard, unsolved problems even in traditional KG work. Assuming they can be efficiently integrated into a dynamic, LLM-driven system without significant complexity or performance degradation is a major risk.
- Triplet Schema Suitability for All Knowledge: While good for structured facts, assuming the triplet schema is universally effective for capturing the full range of episodic or semantic knowledge LLMs might learn is an assumption.
- Scalability of Graph Dynamics: Implementing and running the remaining graph algorithms (consolidation, k-core) on a potentially dense triplet graph as it grows could introduce new computational bottlenecks.
- Validation Bottle Neck: Without fixing the slow evaluation process, tuning the system and demonstrating significant performance gains will be severely limited, making it hard to prove the project's value.
- Persistent Compute Issues: Continued reliance on unstable compute environment risks delays and lost work, especially as more complex testing or larger models might be desired.

## DECIDE
- Immediate Priority 1: Address Reconciliation and Consolidation: This is the most critical, identified technical challenge. Research, prototype, and evaluate different approaches (algorithmic logic, LLM-guided structured updates, hybrid methods) focusing on feasibility and efficiency within the triplet schema.
- Immediate Priority 2: Overhaul Validation and Parameter Tuning: Develop an automated, efficient evaluation script for the integrated system, focusing on the previously defined success metrics (recall, update fidelity, potentially game performance metrics) and allowing for faster iteration necessary for hyperparameter tuning (especially for the newly implemented decay/strengthening).
- Concurrent Action: Implement Remaining Core Graph Dynamics: Continue implementing the remaining planned graph algorithms (k-core decomposition, full Semantic vs. Episodic separation/usage plan) as designs for reconciliation/consolidation progress.
- Concurrent Action: Address Compute Workflow Issues: Explore more stable compute environments or robust scripting/tooling (like more reliable checkpointing/download methods) to mitigate the Colab instability, as efficient validation requires a reliable environment.
- Plan Usage of Semantic vs. Episodic Memory: Develop a concrete plan for how the dual memory blocks will interact and how information will flow/be managed between them, based on the triplet schema and implemented dynamics.

## ACT
### Resource Needs
- Significant Developer/Research Time: Particularly needed for tackling the complex reconciliation and consolidation algorithms and refining their implementation within the triplet structure.
- Methodology Time: Dedicated effort to designing and implementing an efficient, automated evaluation framework and a systematic parameter tuning process.
- Stable Compute Access: Still crucial for efficient validation and tuning runs.

### Approaches
- Focused Research: Dive deeper into literature on knowledge graph completion, conflict resolution in KGs, and consolidation techniques relevant to triplet stores.
- Prototype & Evaluate Reconciliation/Consolidation: Build small-scale prototypes to test different logic for handling conflicting or similar triplets (e.g., timestamp-based, confidence-score based, requiring external LLM validation, logical deduction).
- Optimize Evaluation Pipeline: Profile the current evaluation process and look for bottlenecks. Implement efficient graph querying for metric calculation. Design smaller, faster-running subsets of the evaluation data if a full run is too long for iterative tuning.
- Utilize Existing Libraries: Explore if libraries used for graph manipulation (like PyTorch Geometric or others) offer any built-in functionalities or examples for consolidation or conflict resolution in KGs.
- Develop Specific Triple Evaluation Metrics: Define how "recall accuracy" and "update fidelity" are specifically measured within the triplet schema (e.g., percentage of queried triplets correctly retrieved, percentage of added/modified triplets accurately reflecting the source).
- Test TextWorld (if time permits): The suggestion to use TextWorld could be explored as a more complex, dynamic validation environment after basic graph dynamics and validation are solid.
