# LLM Exploration Summary

> Only log the conversations that actually moved your thinking forward. You can ask an LLM to help identify which conversations those were. Then ask another LLM to verify that choice. Then maybe verify that verification...

## Session Focus
What sparked this conversation? (1-2 sentences)
(You can ask an LLM to help write this focus. Then ask another one if it's accurate.)
