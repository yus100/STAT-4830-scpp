# Finding Your Optimization Project

This guide helps you develop your project idea through structured conversations with AI. The goal is to find a project that's both interesting and feasible.

> **Important**: You can share this entire guide with ChatGPT or your preferred LLM and ask it to walk through it with you. The LLM will help structure the conversation and can do a lot of the heavy lifting in exploring ideas and checking feasibility. However, remember that while the LLM can help you brainstorm and validate ideas, it CANNOT choose what matters to you. You must personally care about and be invested in your project - that's something only you can decide.

## Quick Start (15 minutes)
1. Open ChatGPT or your preferred LLM
2. Start with this key question:
   ```
   What's a problem you've encountered that feels inefficient?
   ```

3. Then explore deeper with:
   ```
   Let's explore my background and interests:

   1. Academic Background:
      - What courses have I enjoyed most and why?
      - Which course projects really clicked for me?
      - What mathematical topics do I feel confident about?
      - What technical skills am I trying to develop?

   2. Personal Interests:
      - What problems do I care about solving?
      - What industries interest me?
      - What would I love to make more efficient?
      - What tools or techniques excite me?

   3. Professional Goals:
      - What kind of role do I want after graduation?
      - What would be useful in my upcoming internship?
      - What skills do I want to demonstrate to employers?
      - What kinds of problems exist in my target industry?

   3. Is data available?
   ```

   Critical Considerations:
   ```
   For [specific idea]:
   1. What data would we need?
   2. How would we measure success?
   3. What could go wrong?

   ```

### Phase 2: Technical Validation (30 minutes)

1. **Mathematical Formulation** (10 min)
   Basic Path:
   ```
   For your chosen problem:

## Tips for LLM Interaction

1. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start broad, get specific
   - Ask for examples and counterexamples
   - Request simpler alternatives when stuck

2. **Reality Checks**
   - Ask "What could go wrong?"
   - Request resource estimates
   - Verify PyTorch compatibility

3. **Getting Unstuck**
   ```
   I'm stuck on [specific aspect].
   Can you:
   1. Show me a simpler version?
   2. Break this into smaller steps?
   3. Suggest an alternative approach?
   ```

4. **Validation Questions**
   - "How would we know this works?"
   - "What would a minimal test look like?"
   - "What should we try first?"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Too Ambitious**
   - Start small, add complexity later
   - Get something working first
   - Plan for gradual improvements

2. **Too Vague**
   - Define concrete success criteria
   - Specify what you're optimizing
   - Know your constraints

3. **Too Complex**
   - Prefer simple, working solutions
   - Add sophistication gradually
   - Keep initial scope minimal

## Next Steps

1. Complete each phase in order
2. Save your LLM conversations
3. Draft your proposal
4. Get feedback from peers
5. Revise and refine

Remember: A good project starts simple but has room to grow. Focus on getting a basic version working, then improve from there.
